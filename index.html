        <p class ="about-p">  My name is Cody Luckmann. I am currently a student enrolled in devCodeCamp full stack program. I am from Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin and am also a full-time employee at Symmetrix Software Inc. based out of Pewaukee, Wisconsin. The tech world has always been of interest to me and now I am finally getting into it for myself. I have held many jobs already in my lifetime but nothing compares to learning software development. I am a huge fan of problem solving and that's just what I get to do everyday! While I am just getting my feet wet in the world of software development, I can't wait for what challenges and experiences wait for me in the future!</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
